# Fix Buy/Sell System Issues

## Issues Identified:

1. **Database Function Missing**: The `execute_trade_match_debug` function is not deployed
2. **Limit Order Matching**: Works but fails due to missing database function
3. **Market Orders**: Should work but may have similar issues

## Fixes Required:

### 1. Deploy Database Function (HIGH PRIORITY)
Run `deploy-db-function.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to create the missing function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION execute_trade_match_debug(...)
RETURNS TEXT
SECURITY DEFINER
```

### 2. Test System
Use `test-buy-sell-system.html` to verify:
- Market buy/sell orders
- Limit buy/sell orders  
- Order book functionality
- Automatic matching

### 3. Current System Status:

**Market Orders (executeMarketTrade)**:
- ✅ Logic correct
- ✅ Uses 'pending' status (matches constraint)
- ✅ Updates orders properly
- ⚠️ May fail if no liquidity

**Limit Orders (executeAutomaticTrade)**:
- ✅ Logic correct
- ✅ Enhanced matching system
- ❌ Fails due to missing database function
- ❌ Function not deployed

## Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Deploy database function**:
   ```bash
   # Copy content from deploy-db-function.sql
   # Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   # Run query
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   # Open test-buy-sell-system.html in browser
   # Login first at index.html
   # Run tests to verify functionality
   ```

3. **Verify automatic matching**:
   - Place a limit buy order
   - Place a limit sell order with overlapping price
   - Should automatically match and create trade

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

- **Market Buy**: Fills from cheapest sells, creates trade records
- **Market Sell**: Fills from highest buys, creates trade records  
- **Limit Buy**: Places order, checks for matches, executes if found
- **Limit Sell**: Places order, checks for matches, executes if found
- **Auto-matching**: Limit orders automatically match when prices overlap

## Error Messages to Watch For:

- ✅ "function execute_trade_match_debug() does not exist" → Deploy function
- ✅ "violates check constraint trades_status_check" → Function uses 'pending' now
- ⚠️ "Insufficient liquidity" → Normal behavior when no matching orders
- ⚠️ "Please sign in to trade" → User authentication required
