# Claude Context - WBX: WebCash-Bitcoin Exchange

## Purpose

This file stores session information between Claude Code sessions to provide context for future conversations. Before closing a session, key progress, decisions, and context should be added here to maintain continuity in the next session. Sessions should be added to the log like a journal. Previous sessions should be retained by default.

## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Framework setup and initialization

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Framework Setup**: Completed initial template customization and framework initialization
2. **Project Analysis**: Analyzed existing codebase structure and technical implementation
3. **Documentation Creation**: Created claude.md, app-framework.md, and claude-context.md files
4. **Architecture Review**: Reviewed WBX exchange technical framework and implementation

#### Key Findings:
- Project is a WebCash-Bitcoin exchange with non-custodial P2P trading
- Uses vanilla JavaScript frontend with Supabase backend
- Implements real-time order matching and market price calculations
- Has complete foundation code already implemented (app.js, index.html, styles.css)

#### Decisions Made:
- Framework templates customized for WBX project specifics
- Development workflow established with session management
- Technical documentation structure created
- Project context preserved for future sessions

#### Session Outcome:
- Framework setup complete - all templates customized successfully
- Project documentation now reflects actual WBX exchange implementation (35% complete)
- Corrected initial overestimate of completion status
- Ready for normal development sessions with accurate context available

## Key Information to Preserve

### Technical Decisions
- Vanilla JavaScript chosen for simplicity and performance
- Supabase selected for serverless backend and real-time capabilities
- Non-custodial approach for security and regulatory compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation

### Known Issues
- Supabase configuration requires actual project credentials
- Market order execution logic needs database transaction implementation
- Settlement process requires external API integration completion
- Real-time subscription setup may need debugging

### Development Patterns
- Modular object-oriented JavaScript structure
- Event-driven UI management
- Real-time subscription handling
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
