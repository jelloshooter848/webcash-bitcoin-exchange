# Claude Context - WBX: WebCash-Bitcoin Exchange

## Purpose

This file stores session information between Claude Code sessions to provide context for future conversations. Before closing a session, key progress, decisions, and context should be added here to maintain continuity in the next session. Sessions should be added to the log like a journal. Previous sessions should be retained by default.

## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Framework setup and initialization

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Framework Setup**: Completed initial template customization and framework initialization
2. **Project Analysis**: Analyzed existing codebase structure and technical implementation
3. **Documentation Creation**: Created claude.md, app-framework.md, and claude-context.md files
4. **Architecture Review**: Reviewed WBX exchange technical framework and implementation

#### Key Findings:
- Project is a WebCash-Bitcoin exchange with non-custodial P2P trading
- Uses vanilla JavaScript frontend with Supabase backend
- Implements real-time order matching and market price calculations
- Has complete foundation code already implemented (app.js, index.html, styles.css)

#### Decisions Made:
- Framework templates customized for WBX project specifics
- Development workflow established with session management
- Technical documentation structure created
- Project context preserved for future sessions

#### Session Outcome:
- Framework setup complete - all templates customized successfully
- Project documentation now reflects actual WBX exchange implementation (35% complete)
- Corrected initial overestimate of completion status
- Ready for normal development sessions with accurate context available

### Session 2: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Backend integration and authentication implementation

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Supabase Project Setup**: Created live project with credentials configuration
2. **Database Schema Implementation**: Deployed orders/trades tables with RLS policies
3. **Authentication Integration**: Fixed signup form bug and verified auth flow
4. **Connection Testing**: Validated Supabase connectivity and database operations
5. **Progress Documentation**: Updated project status to 55% complete

#### Key Findings:
- Signup form was missing email/password inputs (critical bug fix)
- Supabase email confirmation needed to be disabled for testing
- Database schema successfully deployed with proper security policies
- Authentication flow working end-to-end (signup, signin, signout)

#### Decisions Made:
- Used SQL script for database schema instead of manual table creation
- Disabled email confirmation to simplify testing workflow
- Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection
- Created comprehensive database indexes for query performance

#### Session Outcome:
- Backend integration milestone complete (4/4 tasks)
- Authentication system fully functional and tested
- Project advanced from 35% to 55% completion
- Ready for core trading feature implementation (market order execution)

## Key Information to Preserve

### Technical Decisions
- Vanilla JavaScript chosen for simplicity and performance
- Supabase selected for serverless backend and real-time capabilities
- Non-custodial approach for security and regulatory compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation

### Known Issues
- Market order execution has TODO placeholders (app.js lines 159, 220)
- Order matching engine needs complete implementation
- Settlement process requires external API integration completion
- Real-time order book updates need testing with live data

### Development Patterns
- Modular object-oriented JavaScript structure
- Event-driven UI management
- Real-time subscription handling
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
