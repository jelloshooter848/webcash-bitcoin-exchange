# Claude Context - WBX: WebCash-Bitcoin Exchange

## Purpose

This file stores session information between Claude Code sessions to provide context for future conversations. Before closing a session, key progress, decisions, and context should be added here to maintain continuity in the next session. Sessions should be added to the log like a journal. Previous sessions should be retained by default.

## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Framework setup and initialization

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Framework Setup**: Completed initial template customization and framework initialization
2. **Project Analysis**: Analyzed existing codebase structure and technical implementation
3. **Documentation Creation**: Created claude.md, app-framework.md, and claude-context.md files
4. **Architecture Review**: Reviewed WBX exchange technical framework and implementation

#### Key Findings:
- Project is a WebCash-Bitcoin exchange with non-custodial P2P trading
- Uses vanilla JavaScript frontend with Supabase backend
- Implements real-time order matching and market price calculations
- Has complete foundation code already implemented (app.js, index.html, styles.css)

#### Decisions Made:
- Framework templates customized for WBX project specifics
- Development workflow established with session management
- Technical documentation structure created
- Project context preserved for future sessions

#### Session Outcome:
- Framework setup complete - all templates customized successfully
- Project documentation now reflects actual WBX exchange implementation (35% complete)
- Corrected initial overestimate of completion status
- Ready for normal development sessions with accurate context available

### Session 2: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Backend integration and authentication implementation

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Supabase Project Setup**: Created live project with credentials configuration
2. **Database Schema Implementation**: Deployed orders/trades tables with RLS policies
3. **Authentication Integration**: Fixed signup form bug and verified auth flow
4. **Connection Testing**: Validated Supabase connectivity and database operations
5. **Progress Documentation**: Updated project status to 55% complete

#### Key Findings:
- Signup form was missing email/password inputs (critical bug fix)
- Supabase email confirmation needed to be disabled for testing
- Database schema successfully deployed with proper security policies
- Authentication flow working end-to-end (signup, signin, signout)

#### Decisions Made:
- Used SQL script for database schema instead of manual table creation
- Disabled email confirmation to simplify testing workflow
- Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection
- Created comprehensive database indexes for query performance

#### Session Outcome:
- Backend integration milestone complete (4/4 tasks)
- Authentication system fully functional and tested
- Project advanced from 35% to 55% completion
- Ready for core trading feature implementation (market order execution)

### Session 3: 2025-07-15
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Enhanced exchange features and order matching system

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Enhanced Order Matching**: Upgraded limit orders to walk entire book like market orders
2. **Self-Trade Prevention**: Added protection against users matching their own orders
3. **Order Cancellation**: Implemented cancel functionality with proper security
4. **Admin Panel**: Built integrated debugging interface for complete database visibility
5. **Trade History**: Added detailed trade display with user highlighting
6. **Better Order Management**: Created "My Orders" section with quick cancel buttons
7. **Database Function Debugging**: Identified and debugged RLS permission issues

#### Key Findings:
- Row Level Security (RLS) prevented cross-user order updates during automatic matching
- Database trades table has constraint limiting status to ('pending', 'settled', 'failed') 
- Order matching logic was working but blocked by database permissions
- Real-time sync issues when orders match across different user sessions
- Console debugging revealed specific constraint violations and permission errors

#### Technical Breakthroughs:
- Built comprehensive admin panel for real-time database monitoring
- Created database function with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS
- Enhanced automatic matching to support multi-level order book walking
- Implemented proper buyer/seller ID assignment in trade records

#### Current Status:
- **85% Complete**: Core exchange functionality implemented and mostly working
- **Automatic Matching**: Logic complete, blocked by database constraint on trade status
- **UI/UX**: Professional-grade interface with proper order management
- **Security**: RLS properly configured, self-trade prevention active

#### Session Outcome:
- Major feature enhancement milestone achieved
- Identified specific database constraint blocking final functionality
- Built robust debugging tools for future development
- Ready for final constraint fix to complete automatic matching system

## Key Information to Preserve

### Technical Decisions
- Vanilla JavaScript chosen for simplicity and performance
- Supabase selected for serverless backend and real-time capabilities
- Non-custodial approach for security and regulatory compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design implementation

### Known Issues
- **CRITICAL**: Database constraint blocks trade creation - trades table only allows status ('pending', 'settled', 'failed') but function tries to insert 'completed'
- **CRITICAL**: RLS policies prevent cross-user order updates during automatic matching - requires database function with SECURITY DEFINER
- Real-time sync issues - User A doesn't see updates when User B's actions affect their orders
- Trade status semantics unclear - need to decide between 'pending' vs 'settled' for completed trades

### Critical Fixes Needed (Next Session):
1. Fix database constraint: Either update trades table constraint or use 'pending'/'settled' status
2. Apply working database function (debug-db-function.sql with 'pending' status)
3. Test complete automatic matching flow
4. Implement real-time notifications for cross-user updates

### Development Patterns
- Modular object-oriented JavaScript structure
- Event-driven UI management
- Real-time subscription handling
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
