## Session Log

### Session 1 (2025-07-14)
**Accomplished**:
- Analyzed existing codebase (empty except for documentation)
- Reviewed technical framework requirements
- Created progress tracking system
- **MAJOR**: Created complete frontend foundation
  - Full directory structure (`utils/` folder)
  - Complete HTML interface with auth, market, and order book sections
  - Responsive CSS styling for mobile and desktop
  - Full JavaScript application logic with all core functions
  - API helpers for WebCash and Bitcoin integrations
  - Supabase configuration template ready

**Current State**: 
- Backend integration complete with working authentication
- Supabase project configured with live database
- User signup/signin/signout fully functional
- Database schema deployed (orders, trades tables with RLS policies)
- Ready for market order execution implementation

**Technical Implementation Notes**:
- `supabase-config.js`: Now configured with live project credentials
- Authentication flow: Fixed signup form bug, email confirmation disabled
- Database: Created orders/trades tables with proper indexes and security
- Real-time subscriptions: Infrastructure ready for order book updates
- Testing: Connection and auth flow verified working

**Issues to Address**:
- Market order execution has TODO placeholders (lines 159, 220 in app.js)
- Order matching engine needs implementation
- Real-time order book updates need testing
- External API integrations (WebCash/Bitcoin) not yet implemented

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Implement market order execution (replace TODOs in app.js)
2. Test order placement and matching
3. Implement order book real-time updates
4. Test complete buy/sell trading flow
5. Add external API integrations (WebCash/Bitcoin validation)

## Technical Requirements Summary

Based on `WBX_Technical_Framework.md`:

**Tech Stack**: 
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- External: WebCash API, Bitcoin blockchain API

**Key Features**:
- Non-custodial P2P trading
- Real-time market price display
- One-click market buy/sell
- Order book with limit orders
- Automated order matching
- Settlement instructions post-trade

**Architecture**:
- Single-page browser application
- Serverless backend via Supabase
- Real-time updates via subscriptions
- External API integrations for validation

## Implementation Notes

### Code Architecture
- **Frontend**: Complete vanilla JS SPA with modular functions
- **State Management**: AppState object tracks user, orders, prices
- **API Patterns**: Async/await with try/catch error handling
- **UI Updates**: Event-driven with real-time subscriptions ready
- **Security**: Input validation and JWT auth via Supabase

### Key Functions Ready
- `Auth.signUp/signIn/signOut()` - Complete auth flow
- `Market.calculateMarketPrice()` - Order book price calculation  
- `Market.marketBuy/marketSell()` - Trading execution logic
- `UI.renderAuthSection()` - Dynamic auth state rendering
- `Utils.showNotification()` - User feedback system

### Database Schema Needed (from framework)
```sql
-- Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
-- Orders table: id, user_id, type, amount_wc, price_btc, btc_address, status
-- Trades table: id, buyer_id, seller_id, amount_wc, total_btc, status, settled_at
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Open `index.html` in browser (should load without errors)
2. Check console for "WBX Exchange loaded successfully!" message
3. Create Supabase project ‚Üí Update config ‚Üí Test auth
4. Add sample orders ‚Üí Test price calculation
5. Test market buy/sell UI (will fail until DB connected)
